Future of Ghost in the Filesystem. Goals presented in order of ascending loftiness.
* Redo the image layer to have a more clear solution other than the current word salad. I am not proud of this puzzle compared to the other ones.
* Make some kind of postmortem/retrospective youtube video
* Create a sequel
* * as a commercial project
* * * It should be able to release on steam somehow (probably won't happen)
* * * * Do I have to ship a "virtual machine" to steam?
* * * * * It's possible to "cheat" and have the contents of the filesystem actually react to the player's actions. This also hampers some original charm of the game: all external notetaking and file modifications were still inside of the game because it took place in the filesystem.

something weird happened on my computer... the last accessed date on some of my files is showing a time in the future. this shouldn't really be possible so i don't know what's going on. it definitely doesn't have anything to do with the ghost summoning. that didn't work because ghosts aren't real, even if it was really funny. probably just a little glitch that'll fix itself when I do an update. in the meantime I think I'll snack on some delicious cheese. cheese is so good! whenever I'm in a bad mood cheese always makes me feel better. it truly is the best of all the foods.

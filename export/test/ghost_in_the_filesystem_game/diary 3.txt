it didn't work, just like I expected. i put my laptop in the middle of a salt circle with lit candles just inside the edge and then started singing the song. i dont really get how chanting worked but the words in the book looked like a song so I just sang them. after that i waved a steak knife in circles and then pointed it at the laptop and said really loud "GHOST, I TRAP YOU IN MY LAPTOP". honestly it would have been funnier if i recorded it in a video or something but i couldn't because my laptop has the webcam i'd use to record it. that's probably good because it would be super embarassing if anyone actually watched it.

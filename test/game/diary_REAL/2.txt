pirates are so cool! i've been learning about them all week. "x marks the spot" is such a cliche but if it works it works. the movies where they hide the treasure map in other stuff is way cooler. in one movie there were a bunch of fake maps but there were little puzzle pieces in each of the fake maps... pretty weird but I had a hunch about what was going on. the funniest part was how the movie proved me right! a little kid street urchin character stole some of the maps and then tore out the puzzle pieces and started to put them together. when the pirates caught that slimy little bugger the first mate was about to kill her but then the captain saw she was putting the pieces together and brought her onto the crew. good thing the stupid "women on ships bad luck" superstition wasn't a thing for these pirates, I hate when they have that kind of dumb trope. after putting the puzzle pieces together the pirates found the treasure. it was pretty good and apparently they made a sequel where the girl is grown up and captain of her own pirate crew, that's neat. gonna watch that one tomorrow.

i watched the sequel but didn't really like it... nothing I liked about the first one was there. it just felt off. maybe I was a little distracted... some of the files in this secret diary are being accessed from the future again. did the ghost figure out my password? i need to make an even more secret diary... a super secret diary that not even the weird ghost I summoned from the future can access. at this point there's definitely SOMETHING weird going on with my computer... the "last accessed" shouldn't be from the future. that just doesn't happen. i even checked a few times and the last accessed on some files changed to a couple of different future dates as if the ghost looked at the file multiple times. even if ghosts aren't real and I didn't summon a ghost into my computer (there's no way I actually did that) it's okay to call it a ghost. if I wasn't thinking about all this crap maybe I'd have enjoyed that movie more.

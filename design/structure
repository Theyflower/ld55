different "stages"?

stage 1 mandatory diary entries:
* password for secret_diary clue
* studying to summon a spirit to act as a digital assistant
* failed to summon anything
* began studying stenography
* noticed file access metadata has impossible dates. decision to password encrypt diaries

stage 2 mandatory diary entries:
* paranoid contemplation of why the files were getting messed up
* clue for next
* notice files access metadata is from the future again. accidentally summoned a ghost from the future
* devised a new method to hide the files (WHAT IS THIS PUZZLE?)

stage 3 mandatory diary entries:
* pre-required clue is "studying image based stego. it's really complicated but i think I can conceptualize it"
* switching to image based diaries. intentionally corrupting them slightly so that they are more difficult to read. also have an idea for a new way to hide diaries if they get found this time
* clue for next
* notice files being accessed, increased insanity
* implementing the next step of secret diaries


stage 4 mandatory diary entries:
* pre clue is studying spectrograms, they seem cool (include example spectrograms)"
* switching to audio diaries, maybe the ghost won't be able to listen to them
* tried to make some spectograms + test files
* noticed the audio diaries are being listened to. confused and afraid. unsure how to keep the diaries safe
* i have figured out how to keep my diaries safe from the ghost. confident, self-reassured


stage 5 mandatory: (spectogram 3 puzzle pieces that must bee screenshot LOL + 3 in an image document)
* back to a text diary. feeling good about finally being able to write down thoughts in private again. candid confession about fear of being judged by an anonymous stranger
* maybe don't do this.
* i'll do this in a "future release"

THEME: summoning

preconceived ideas:
* you are viewing files of someone else's computer. the name of the game was intruder and you are the intruder who is intruding in their filesystem
* the victim notices and tries to protect their files from you
* eventually the victim gives up and says YOU WIN. they are just going to buy a new computer and abandon the one you are intruding on

add the themme?
* they can try to summon a fairy or something to act as a virtual assistant?
* the whole game happens because the victim summons SOMETHING into their computer

puzzle ideas
* guess the easy to guess password for the "secret_diary.zip" after the victim notices the metadata of their files having dates from the future
* assemble separate images of jigsaw pieces scattered around the filesystem to learn a password to a zip folder
* view a spectogram of an audio file to learn a password to a zip folder

DEADLY HILLS
* richard stallman should be able to fully enjoy the game on a computer he chooses to use
* no internet needed at all
* the puzzles should be very easy but conceptually interesting (this is a proof of concept)
* i'd like to be able to upload the whole game to discord without nitro, it would be a funny way for it to propogate

design
* each stage should have clues for how the next stage might need to be completed
* the writing should become more frantic with each stage. gradual deterioration of spelling and grammar

FINAL STEP BEFORE EXPORT
* touch every file so that their metadata is correct

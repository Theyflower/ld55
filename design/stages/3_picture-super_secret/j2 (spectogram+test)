so far so good. the ghost isn't in here!!! i'm safe. time to make a real diary entry. it's been a while since I got to do that. the part of the stenography book I'm on right now is about spectograms. there's a bunch of examples about how albums have had hidden images in them and I think it's cool. i tried making some of my own and it worked! i drew a bunny and a frog and then put them into the spectogram of some sound files. when I open them with Audacity and set it to spectogram view instead of the default waveform view the pictures are all visible! they got a little squished but that's fine.

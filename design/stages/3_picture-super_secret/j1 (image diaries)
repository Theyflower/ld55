this ghost feels inescapable. i've resorted to typing my thoughts up in GIMP. this will work. the ghost can only look at text files. text in a picture is totally different. i'm even going to corrupt these slightly using Audacity so that it's harder for the ghost to view them. this might seem crazy but it's NOT! i'm faced with a really weird situation and I need to do whatever it takes to keep my private thoughts safe from the ghost.

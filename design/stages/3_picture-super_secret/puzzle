this is the image one
there's going to be a jigsaw puzzle of multiple pieces that form a grid but some pieces are longer than others (like 2x1 or 1x2)

there will be a few shapes that the "edges" of the pieces can have. in general each shape should only go "out" on each north/south/east/west edge of a single piece

shapes:
* semicircle
* square
* triangle
* trapezoid wide end far
* trapezoid wide end close

the edge shapes should be on every "grid" edge of every piece

inside of each piece one word will be a different color from all the rest. this is the important word

read all of the important words together for a clue that makes the next password very obvious


MAKING IT NOW!
udlr -> it cuts in that direction

urdl semicircle
urdl square
urdl triangle
xxxx trapezoid

i have 8 verts and 8 hori to place
i have 12 vert spots and 12 hori spots
remove 4 of each

i have 24 spots but only 16 to place
need to remove 8 verts

there's 8 pieces but only 4 journals, probably. so 2 do pieces per journal

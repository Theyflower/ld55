IT HAPPENED AGAIN! the ghost is looking at my files. the last accessed date is wrong. it's from the future again. this should be impossible but i think i really did summon a freaking ghost into my computer. now it's just reading my diaries like some kind of perverted freak! i hate this ghost. not even a virus scan could find anything wrong. i need a deeper diary behind another layer if i want to keep safe from the ghost. that friend was right, trying to summon the ghost totally led to a path of disaster and suffering.

i've got it now. even if the ghost can read my diaries now it can't do this to my next ones. i was going to use the puzzle pieces for something else but i really need something to keep my private diary safe from the ghost intruder that i accidentally summoned into my computer. ghost intruder that i accidentally summoned? what the heck am i even talking about?! this is crazy i feel like i'm losing my mind. these diaries were supposed to let me relax and speak my mind truthfully where nobody else can read it...

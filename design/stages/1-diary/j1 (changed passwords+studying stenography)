it's that time of year again! time to change all my passwords. for some reason I also had the urge to keep a diary! because nobody else is going to read this I can leave a little clue for myself about what password I'm going to use everywhere from now on. it's "iloveX" where X is my favorite food. writing down the whole password feels wrong, so I'm not going to do it. maybe once I'm better at stenography i'll give writing down my password another go. this book I got from the library about it is full of cool information. there's also this occult book I got that talks about how to summon ghosts and stuff to do your bidding. it would be pretty funny if I had a ghost as like a personal assistant inside my computer, but ghosts aren't real.

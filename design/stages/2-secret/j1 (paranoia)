i don't know why the files were being accessed from the future. that doesn't make ANY SENSE! it's so weird. there's no way it's a ghost, I didn't summon one. it would be bound under my control... right? there's no way I summoned a ghost, and even if I somehow did that... there's NO WAY that it's just stuck in my computer. talking about this makes me feel silly. ghosts probably aren't... ghosts AREN'T REAL. i'm just going to keep my new diaries in here because it'll make me feel better. the idea of some intruder reading my intimate files creeps me out. there's probably no ghost from the future reading my diary. there's no ghost from the future reading my diary. ghosts aren't real and nothing happened when I tried to summon a ghost into my computer to be my personal assistant program. i'm just going to watch a documentary about pirates to take my mind off of this crap

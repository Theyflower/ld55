i'm going to need a super secret diary. the idea of some kind of ghost intruder reading these diaries REALLY freaks me out. even if it's password protected I want to remember the password. i have an idea of how but it's pretty cliche... it'll be fine. my next diary will have a much better password. everything will be okay
